There are a minimum of five servers:
- One for the web frontend that the crash reporting daemon talks to.
- One for the Cassandra server that the web frontend talks to.
- One for the RabbitMQ server.
- Two architecture retracer servers, one for amd64 and one for i386.

Obviously you'll want more than this.

Set up oops-repository on the webserver:
  bzr branch lp:~ev/oops-repository/whoopsie-daisy oops-repository
  (cd oops-repository; python setup.py build; sudo python setup.py install)

Install pycassa on the webserver. Run oopsrepository/schema.py from
oops-repository and backend/schema.py from whoopsie-daisy to create the default
schema.
Install pika on the webserver for talking to the MQ.
Install rabbitmq-server on the RabbitMQ server.  Make sure this is at least 2.0.
Install libapache2-mod-wsgi on the webserver, enable mod_rewrite, and configure
using the sample file.

Run `python process_core.py` on a server with access to the location where the
core files are written.
