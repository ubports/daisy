# The number of days that we use to weight the errors in the average errors per
# calendar day calculation such that an error counts as:
# 
# min(number of days since its first error in the given release, 90) / 90.0
#
# The lower it is, the greater the spikes from user influxes. The higher it is,
# the slower the warning of actual worsening.
# 
# The sum of these weighted errors form the numerator of the average errors per
# calendar day calculation. The denominator is the number of unique machines
# seen in the 90 days prior to the calculated day that are responsible for the
# errors in the numerator. This latter clarification is necessary as we receive
# plenty of errors from non-Official releases.

RAMP_UP = 90
